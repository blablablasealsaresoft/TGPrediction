## 💡 Why No Trades Yet

**It's 1:36 PM on October 23rd - market may be quiet**

**Normal reasons for no immediate trades:**
1. **No new token launches** - Launches happen in waves
2. **No high-score wallets trading** - Wallets scores still calculating
3. **Market quiet period** - Activity peaks during certain hours

**This is NORMAL!** The bot will trade when opportunities appear.

---

## ⏰ Peak Trading Times

**Most active:**
- 9 AM - 12 PM EST (Morning pump)
- 2 PM - 6 PM EST (Afternoon activity)
- 8 PM - 11 PM EST (Evening degens)

**Quietest:**
- 1 AM - 6 AM EST (Overnight)
- Weekends (lower volume)

You're in a moderate activity period.
