## 🚀 Once Wallet Shows Correctly

### Start Everything:
```
/snipe_enable      # Enable auto-sniper
/autostart         # Start copy trading 441 wallets
```

## ⚠️ If STILL Wrong

If `/wallet` STILL shows a different address:

1. **Check bot output** - look for errors in terminal
2. **Try `/start` again** - should show "Balance: 0.2000 SOL"
3. **Let me know** - I'll investigate further

## ✅ Database Confirmed

```
User ID: 6594416344 (you)
Wallet: mDSm6bqKdKc8ARbsdAkkHKzDzAqERuFxMChiGmuUDaR
Balance: 0.200000 SOL
```

**The wallet is definitely there - bot just needed fresh restart!**

---

**Test `/wallet` now and let me know what you see!** 🎯
